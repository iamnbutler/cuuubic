				<h2>Chapter One &mdash;</h2>
				<h1>The Impostor Inside</h1>
				<p class="text-intro">There is a voice inside of me. One that constantly tells me that I don’t belong. The truth is, sometimes I believe that voice.</p>
				<p>The impostor is there to remind me of the things I’m afraid to say. <span class="i">You are not a real designer. You just got lucky. You are not as talented as your peers.</span> Even while I read stories of many great people who struggled with and wrote about the same thing I wonder if I can really compare my feelings to what they felt.</p>
				<p>In my early years of post-secondary I struggled greatly with Impostor Syndrome. I didn’t enjoy classes and I felt like I was learning more on my own. Yet I saw the skill gap widening between my friends and I. It had become a chasm. I didn’t belong, and I missed out on many opportunities.</p>
				<p>I was afraid to apply to internships. I was unwilling to leave my job to find something more challenging because I was afraid I had lucked out with my position and would not be able to find something else. I didn’t seek mentorship because I was afraid of my lack of skills being exposed.</p>
				<p><span class="i">Afraid, afraid, afraid.</span></p>
				<p><span class="pull">The crippling fear that impostor syndrome brings can leave you in a hole that feels like you just can’t get out of.</span></p>
				<p class="divider"></p>
				<p>Well — I’m here to tell you that there is hope. <span class="b">You are not an impostor.</span></p>
				<p>You did not end up here by accident.</p>
				<p>You don’t have to give in to the voice in your head, and here is how you are going to prove it:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="b">Break the cycle.</span> <span class="i">Every time you feel like you don’t belong reflect on your accomplishments. Tell yourself that you do belong, and that you are here for a reason. Take joy in finding what that reason is and working towards accomplishing it.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Confide in others.</span> <span class="i">You might be surprised at how many people feel the same way. Encourage each other.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Be confident.</span> <span class="i">Don’t place your value in other’s opinions of you. Even the positive opinions others express about you can cripple your self confidence.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Trust others.</span> <span class="i">Trust that they know what they are doing. You were hired for this job for a reason. You made it into that school for a reason. By doubting yourself you are doubting everyone involved in the process. And for the people that trusted you, create something good!</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Finally, <span class="b">challenge yourself</span>. Don’t shy away from a problem or learning a skill because it makes you feel uncomfortable or you feel like you don’t deserve to contribute.</p>

				<h2>Chapter Three &mdash;</h2>
				<h1>Make! Make! Make!</h1>
				<div class="text-intro">There is a universe of brilliant ideas locked inside the mind. The next billion dollar product, a cure to cancer, or even just an experience that makes a life a little easier. But those ideas are useless if they remain inside.</div>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<p>In high school I studied journalism quite extensively. I led the yearbook production as Editor-in-Chief in my junior year and did a bulk of the layout for our school’s newspaper. At some point between the start of my senior year and graduation though I decided journalism was not for me and I wanted to pursue design. Over the four years I was in high school I made a lot of things, but entering university I found a thirst to learn.</p>

				<p>I spent all my time spare time learning. I learned HTML &amp; CSS, I followed all the latest designs on Dribbble and coded my own widgets on Codepen. If there was a new technology I was probably digging into it and discovering how it worked. It felt great to know so many things, and to get the attention of my peers for being an expert at so much. But I was confused when I started seeing people that knew less than me were producing better work. That’s when I realized the mistake I had made.</p>

				<p class="pull">I was satisfied with learning how to make things, but never actually made anything.</p>

				<p>Yes, now I could write code in 10 languages, create games in JS, Unity and Unreal, work in multiple 3D softwares and can build with Arduino and Pi, but what do I have to show for all of these things? Not a whole lot of anything. I’m not suggesting that learning is not important, but taking the next step to making is equally important.</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<p>Don’t fall into the same trap that I did.</p>
				<p>Get out there, stop thinking and just <span class="b">make something</span>.</p>
				<p>Make something that you want to show your friends, your family, your coworkers and even people on the street.</p>
				<p>Your idea doesn’t have to change the world. If it does, great! But in the meantime you are learning as you make. Every mockup you create, every business plan you brainstorm is another step on your journey.</p>
				<p>Keep making until you find an idea you fall in love with. Then keep making after that. Teach others how to make, so that the next generation won’t miss this important lesson either.</p>
				<p>Don’t just make things. Finish things. It doesn’t have to be an entire social media platform or an RPG-scale game, but finish what you make and package it so that you are proud of it. Going half way doesn’t count.</p>
				<p>You will surprise yourself with every project you finish that the quality of your work will improve greatly. People will start taking notice. People will start listening to your ideas. Maybe not every idea will be a success, but don’t let that stop you. Keep making, and don’t stop learning either. Finding a balance between the two is the key to making great things.</p>
				<p>Get out there and make something great!</p>
