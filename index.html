					<h1>Defining Emotion</h1>
					
					<p>The emotion we are discussing is dealing with what makes us like (or not like) something, and how it makes us feel. When you look at an abnormally vivid sunset what is it that creates that sublime and calming feeling? When you view a beautiful painting and feel a connection, or watch a particularly well-shot film where color, composition and environment are carefully considered then you experience this emotion.</p>

				<h2>About the Project</h2>
				<p>This is a project dedicated to making, to exploring shape and color and pushing myself to try new things. When it comes to exploration sometimes the process is more important than the product or the goal. The work created is valuable because it is part of the process for the to find your own voice. While whether the work is good or not will be just by the community as a whole, the value referred to here is the experience obtained while making. Through crafting a body of work you can begin to discover meaning and a piece of your voice.</p>
				<p>To me, the exciting part of making as design is the idea of finding a problem through exploration rather than starting with a pre-existing problem and designing a solution from there. When you are not starting with a problem it becomes easier to explore without the burden of looking for a solution. Rather your conclusions can be fluid, changing as making brings new ideas to light.</p>
