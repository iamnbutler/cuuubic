				<h2>Chapter One &mdash;</h2>
				<h1>The Impostor Inside</h1>
				<p>There is a voice inside of me. One that constantly tells me that I don’t belong. The truth is, sometimes I believe that voice.</p>
				<p>The impostor is there to remind me of the things I’m afraid to say. You are not a real designer. You just got lucky. You are not as talented as your peers. Even while I read stories of many great people who struggled with and wrote about the same thing I wonder if I can really compare my feelings to what they felt.</p>
				<p>In my early years of post-secondary I struggled greatly with Impostor Syndrome. I didn’t enjoy classes and I felt like I was learning more on my own. Yet I saw the skill gap widening between my friends and I. It had become a chasm. I didn’t belong, and I missed out on many opportunities.</p>
				<p>I was afraid to apply to internships. I was unwilling to leave my job to find something more challenging because I was afraid I had lucked out with my position and would not be able to find something else. I didn’t seek mentorship because I was afraid of my lack of skills being exposed.</p>
				<p><span class="i">Afraid, afraid, afraid.</span></p>
				<p><span class="pull">The crippling fear that impostor syndrome brings can leave you in a hole that feels like you just can’t get out of.</span></p>
				<p class="divider"></p>
				<p>Well — I’m here to tell you that there is hope. <span class="b">You are not an impostor.</span></p>
				<p>You did not end up here by accident.</p>
				<p>You don’t have to give in to the voice in your head, and here is how you are going to prove it:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="b">Break the cycle.</span> <span class="i">Every time you feel like you don’t belong reflect on your accomplishments. Tell yourself that you do belong, and that you are here for a reason. Take joy in finding what that reason is and working towards accomplishing it.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Confide in others.</span> <span class="i">You might be surprised at how many people feel the same way. Encourage each other.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Be confident.</span> <span class="i">Don’t place your value in other’s opinions of you. Even the positive opinions others express about you can cripple your self confidence.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Trust others.</span> <span class="i">Trust that they know what they are doing. You were hired for this job for a reason. You made it into that school for a reason. By doubting yourself you are doubting everyone involved in the process. And for the people that trusted you, create something good!</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Finally, <span class="b">challenge yourself</span>. Don’t shy away from a problem or learning a skill because it makes you feel uncomfortable or you feel like you don’t deserve to contribute.</p>
