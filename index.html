				<h2>Chapter One &mdash;</h2>
				<h1>The Impostor Inside</h1>
				<p>There is a voice inside of me. One that consistently tells me that I don’t belong. The truth is, sometimes I believe that voice.</p>
				<p>The impostor is there to remind me of the things I’m afraid to say. You are not a real designer. You just got lucky. You are not as talented as your peers. Even while I read stories of many great people who struggled with and wrote about the same thing I wonder if I can really compare my feelings to what they felt.</p>
				<p>In my early years of post-secondary I struggled greatly with Impostor Syndrome. I didn’t enjoy classes and I felt like I was learning more on my own. Yet I saw the skill gap widening between my friends and I. It had become a chasm. I didn’t belong, and I missed out on many opportunities.</p>
				<p>I was afraid to apply to internships. I was unwilling to leave my job to find something more challenging because I was afraid I had lucked out with my position and would not be able to find something else. I didn’t seek mentorship because I was afraid of my lack of skills being exposed.</p>
				<p><span class="i">Afraid, afraid, afraid.</span></p>
				<p><span class="pull">The crippling fear that impostor syndrome brings can leave you in a hole that feels like you just can’t get out of.</span></p>
