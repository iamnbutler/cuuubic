				<h2>Chapter One &mdash;</h2>
				<h1>The Impostor Inside</h1>
				<p class="text-intro">
					Everyone has felt that creeping feeling. The feeling that you just couldn’t possibly belong. That somehow you are here by mistake. It’s terrifying because it feels <span class="b">true</span>.
				</p>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<p>There is a voice inside of me. One that constantly tells me that I don’t belong. The truth is, sometimes I believe that voice.</p>
				<p>The impostor is there to remind me of the things I’m afraid to say. <span class="i">You are not a real designer. You just got lucky. You are not as talented as your peers.</span> Even while I read stories of many great people who have struggled with Impostor Syndrome, I wonder if I can really compare my feelings to what their experiences.</p>
				<p>My struggles with self value make me feel like I’m not meant to be here.</p>
				<p>In my early years of post-secondary I struggled greatly with Impostor Syndrome. I didn’t enjoy classes and I felt like I was learning more on my own. Yet I saw the skill gap widening between my friends and I. It had become a chasm. I didn’t belong, and I missed out on many opportunities.</p>
				<p>I was afraid to apply to internships, and unwilling to leave my job to search for something more challenging. I was afraid I was already working over my level and would not be able to find something else. I didn’t seek mentorship because I feared that my lack of skills would be exposed.</p>
				<p><span class="i">Afraid, afraid, afraid.</span></p>
				<p><span class="pull">The crippling fear that impostor syndrome brings can leave you in a hole that feels like you just can’t get out of.</span></p>
				<p class="divider"></p>
				<p>Well — I’m here to tell you that there is hope. You are <span class="b">not</span> an impostor.</p>
				<p>You did not end up here by accident.</p>
				<p>You don’t have to give in to the voice in your head, and here is how you are going to prove it:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="b">Trust others.</span> <span class="i">Trust that they know what they are doing. You were hired for this job for a reason. You made it into that school for a reason. By doubting yourself you are doubting everyone involved in the process. And for the people that trusted you, create something good!</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Break the cycle.</span> <span class="i">Every time you feel like you don’t belong reflect on your accomplishments. Tell yourself that you do belong, and that you are here for a reason. Take joy in finding what that reason is and working towards accomplishing it.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Challenge yourself</span> <span class="i">Don’t shy away from a problem or learning a skill because it takes you out of your comfort zone. You deserve to contribute. Let the world know what you want to say.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Confide in others.</span> <span class="i">You might be surprised at how many people feel the same way. Encourage each other. Sometimes simply verbalizing your thoughts can help you see things differently.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Be confident.</span> <span class="i">Don’t place your value in other’s opinions of you. Even the positive opinions of others can cripple your self confidence. Julie Zhou said it best in her article <a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-imposter-syndrome-9e23e2326d88#.aecfyy60n">The Impostor Syndrome</a>: “Experience makes anything look easy, but insecurities never fully disappear… [however] it gets easier. You start trusting yourself. You’re an imposter less and less, and you’re yourself more and more.”</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>When the voice inside you starts whispering, remember that you are here for a reason. You were not chosen by mistake.</p>
				<p>You worked hard, struggled long and now you have made it to the place you belong.</p>

				<h2>Chapter Two &mdash;</h2>
				<h1>Break The Cycle</h1>
				<p class="intro-text">Nothing is more discouraging than not knowing why you feel so bad. You feel great for weeks at a time and then out of the blue life suddenly feels meaningless.</p>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<p class="i">Disclaimer: I am not a mental health professional. I am an individual with experience dealing with depression, and these are some of my thoughts and a few of the things I did that help me in my situation. I recommend for anyone struggling with serious mental health issues to talk with a counselor about their situation before following any advice given by others.</p>
				<div class="pull">I thought I could fix myself. I was wrong.</div>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<p>Depression is a <span class="b">black hole</span>, a terrifying snowball of emotion that makes the world seem monochromatic and lifeless. And while it is terrible to live with, the most awful part is that it can strike without any notice. Anything can be a trigger, and suddenly you are back at the bottom of the well in darkness, looking up at a small spot of light somewhere far above you.</p>
				<p>Every person’s depression is different. It’s a terrifying uniqueness that makes these feelings difficult to even talk about with others suffering with similar symptoms. This isolation itself leads to even worse symptoms as thoughts ruminate. Depression is hard to discuss as an all encompassing illness or state of mind, depending on how you want to define it.</p>
				<p>To learn how to break the cycle we must consider what makes us feel good. A sense of accomplishment, eating good food, exercise, and varying amounts of interaction with people (depending on in one is an introvert or extrovert.) All of these are things that often make us feel good. Putting on your best clothes or going out for a walk may help when feeling down. But those are only temporary solutions. How to do we break out of this difficult and seemingly endless loop?</p>
				<p>Here are a few things to get started:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="b">Identify thought patterns.</span> <span class="i">What thoughts repeat before a particularly tough spiral of depression? Thoughts about finding a job or completing work on time? Feelings of being overwhelmed by all the tasks to do? Identify if these patterns repeat over and over. This process is called rumination, and is one of the large contributing factors to relapses into depression. By identifying the thought patterns that act as triggers it is possible to stop those processes before they cause damage. Break the cycle by considering what can be controlled in a situation. Discard what cannot be controlled and focus on impacting that which can. <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpsychcentral.com%2Fblog%2Farchives%2F2014%2F02%2F16%2F8-tips-to-help-stop-ruminating%2F">More on rumination</a>.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Accept failures.</span><span class="i">The worst thing about failure is not the failure itself, but the notion that it brings that failure is inevitable. Don’t let failures become a captor. Accept the failure and think about what caused it. Failure is the first of many steps towards success.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Share with others.</span><span class="i">Talk with people that are comfortable. Talk about feelings and fears, and about their experiences. Learn from those that have struggled with similar situations. Don’t be closed to those who are looking to help. Opening up can help the feeling of being alone or burried. With these feelings no longer feeling like a secret it will feel like a weight will be lifted off.</span></li>
					<li><span class="b">Set Goals, reward yourself.</span><span class="i"></span></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Chapter Three &mdash;</h2>
				<h1>Make! Make! Make!</h1>
				<div class="text-intro">There is a universe of brilliant ideas locked inside the mind: The next billion dollar product, a cure to cancer, or even the newest experience that makes a life a little easier. But those ideas are useless if they remain inside.</div>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<p>In high school I studied journalism quite extensively. In my junior year I headed yearbook production as Editor-in-Chief and did the layout for the majority of the school’s newspaper. At some point between the start of my senior year and graduation, however, I decided not to pursue journalism, but design. Throughout my high school career, I made a lot of things. When entering university, however, I shifted my focus creating to learning.</p>

				<p>I spent all my time spare time discovering. I learned HTML &amp; CSS, I followed all the latest designs on Dribbble and coded my own widgets on Codepen. If there was a new technology I was probably digging into it to learn how it worked. I thought I had become an expert in many things. It felt great to know so much, and to hold the attention of my peers. But as I started seeing people who knew less than me produce better work, I was stunned. That’s when I realized I was missing something.</p>

				<p class="pull">I was satisfied with learning how to make things, but never actually made anything.</p>

				<p>Yes, now I could write code in 10 software languages, create games in JS, Unity and Unreal, work in multiple 3D softwares and can build with Arduino and Pi, but what do I have to show for all of these things? Not a whole lot of anything. I’m not suggesting that learning is not important, but taking the next step to making is equally important.</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<p>Don’t fall into the same trap that I did.</p>
				<p>Get out there, stop thinking and just <span class="b">make something</span>.</p>
				<p>Make something to show friends, family, coworkers and even people on the street.</p>
				<p>Ideas don’t have to change the world. If they do, that’s terrific, but in the meantime, learning happens. Every mockup created, and every idea brainstormed is another step of the journey.</p>
				<p>Keep making until there’s an idea to fall in love with. Then keep making after that. Teach others how to make, so that the next generation won’t miss this important lesson either.</p>
				<p>Don’t just make things. Finish things. It doesn’t have to be an entire social media platform or an RPG-scale game, but finish what it, and package it so that it’s something to be proud of. Going half way doesn’t count.</p>
				<p>With each completed project, skills improve. People start taking notice, and listening to your ideas. Not every idea will be a success, but don’t let that be a hindrance . Keep making, and don’t stop learning either. Finding balance between the two is the key to making great things.</p>
				<p>So, get out there and make something great!</p>

				<h2>Chapter Four &mdash;</h2>
				<h1>Kill Your Idols</h1>
				<div class="text-intro">
					In a world of design superstars it is easy to underestimate one's skills by misunderstanding the difference between talent and experience.
				</div>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<p>In my second year of university I had fallen in love with Fantasy Interactive. I was just getting into web in a big way for the first time, and they were doing some of the hottest work out there. I remember the day they released the new USA Today site. I was blown away that they could make a news site so look so great. The interactions that they were coming up with were unlike things I had seen anywhere else on the web. I wanted to be them. I wanted to work there so badly. I remember going up to Anton Repponen to ask about internships. I don’t even remember what he said, all that mattered is that I had talked to him in person.</p>
				<p>I didn’t wake up until I was given this advice from a friend: “Don’t fall in love with your idols. They just have had more time to work at it.” I had never really thought about the people behind the design that I had fallen in love with. Many of the people I look up to have been in the industry for ten years or more. Of course they have had more time to polish their skills. It can be hard to see that when looking at a fine crafted case study or newly launched site, but each of those designers came from the same place. They had to build up their skills over time.</p>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<p>While beginning the journey into the world of design it is inevitable to find designers to idolize. These discoveries can be creative fuel, but can also be a trap. Looking up to a designer without realizing that they just have more (or different) experience may make it seem like getting to the same point is unobtainable.</p>
				<p>It is easy to fall into the trap of devaluing one's own work when constantly comparing with others.</p>
