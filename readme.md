kaishi
================================
Mandarin (开始) or Japanese (開始) for start, or to begin.

##Description

An extremely minimal template for getting projects started. Includes a basic CSS reset and prelinked style.css and scripts.js files. Also includes an offline jQuery fallback.

kaishi does not have any IE fallback JS and is mostly meant for rapid prototyping and experiments.

##Version History

* 1.1 Minor Adjustments
	* Commented out jQuery
		* Not all projects require jQuery, and it is useless to load something you are not using.
		* Simply uncomment line 23 to activate it.
	* Stripped [.clearfix] out of css. Was not being used enough to justify a place in the base css.
* 1.0 Release Version: *Added primary files, stripped comments and added readme*
